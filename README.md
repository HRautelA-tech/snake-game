# snake-game
Made a simple game using C++
The snake can be represented as a list of coordinates that define the position of each segment of the snake on the game
board. The head of the snake is the first element in the list.
The food can be represented by a single coordinate pair that defines its position on the game board.
When the snake eats the food, the food position should be randomized to a new location.
If the snake has hit the walls or hit by itself than the game will be over.
